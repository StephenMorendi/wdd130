            <p>Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya, located in the south-central part of the country.
                It is bordered by Kiambu County to the north and west, Machakos County to the east, and Kajiado County
                to the south.
                The city is a regional hub for transportation, education, information technology, research, and
                commerce, and it is a
                major tourist destination known for its nearby wildlife reserves and vibrant culture.
                Nairobi is also home to many international organizations and serves as Kenya’s political, economic, and
                administrative
                center.</p>
